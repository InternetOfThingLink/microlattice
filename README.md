# Microlattice.js

Microlattice.js® is a JavaScript runtime framework built on Jerryscript. Jerryscript is the Lightweight JavaScript engine for Internet of Things. Microlattice.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model ( base on FreeRTOS Native api, without libuv )that makes it lightweight and efficient.

And... Microlattice.js is Fully support Mediatek Wifi+MCU chip (ex. MT7687, MT7697 ) now!

## Feature
[English]
* Target support for all MTK wifi + MCU chips
* Platform for IoT device (especially: wifi + MCU) with javascript.
* Microlattice.js is adopting the similar coding style used in javascript community providing high performance like C.
* Everything you need like tools, modules, and engine core are modular designed.
* Providing standards for resolving the following issues you may encounter while developing embedded board:
  * Different MCU build tools.
  * Diverse in debug/download code.
  * License: dis-contribute limitation.
  * No common sharing project standard.
  * Existing JS total solution is not light-weighted enough, providing low performance comparing to C.
  * FreeRTOS does not have file system design.

[中文]
* 目標支援所有 MTK wifi + MCU 晶片 (ex. MT7687, MT7697)
* 真正為 IoT device 所設計的 IoT 版 Node.js.
* 針對 Javascript community 所熟悉的 coding style 追求接近 C 的效能
* 每一個細節包含 tool, module, engine core 都是可以拆分重組
* 提供標準解決以下開發 embedded board 常見問題:
  * MCU build tool 環境各家很不一致
  * Debug/ Download code 各家皆不一樣
  * LICENSE 問題：大部份廠商 SDK 皆有 dis-contribute 規範
  * 沒有共同的 sharing project 標準
  * 現成的 Js total solution 不夠輕量，不符合效能接近 C
  * FreeRTOS 沒有 filesystem 的設計 ... 等等

## Microlattice command line

### Usage

* Install

```
npm i microlattice -g
```

* Initialize microlattice project

``` bash
ml create
```

* donwload code to your device

```
ml burn [your bin file]
```

* [TBD] debugger ( use openOCD and GDB )

```
